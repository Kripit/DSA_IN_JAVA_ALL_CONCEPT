Greedy Algorithms in Java

This repo is basically my exploration into greedy algorithms in Java.
I structured it to go step by step, so anyone who wants to learn can follow:

First, check out a super basic greedy example

Then, see a simple coin change problem

Finally, a mid-level activity selection problem (the real deal for interviews/DSA practice)

I tried to explain everything with comments in the code, so you can see why each step works, not just copy-paste.

Why Greedy?

Greedy algorithms are all about making the best local choice at each step, hoping that it leads to the global optimum.

Works in resource allocation, scheduling, coin change, activity selection, and even in some AI GPU scheduling problems.

The main skill here is to recognize when a greedy approach works versus when it fails
