## 1Ô∏è‚É£ WHAT IS TWO POINTER TECHNIQUE?

**Definition:** Using TWO variables (pointers) to traverse an array/string, instead of nested loops.

**Real Life Analogy:**
Imagine you're searching for a pair of shoes in a line:
- **Method 1 (Brute Force):** Check EVERY shoe with EVERY other shoe (nested loops)
- **Method 2 (Two Pointers):** One person starts from LEFT, one from RIGHT, meet in middle

**Visual Representation:**
```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
        ‚Üë                    ‚Üë
       LEFT               RIGHT

Move pointers based on condition!
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ WHEN TO USE TWO POINTERS?

‚úÖ **Use Two Pointers when:**
1. Array/String is **SORTED** (or can be sorted)
2. Need to find **PAIR** of elements
3. Need to find **SUBARRAY** with certain property
4. Optimizing from O(n¬≤) to O(n)

‚ùå **Don't use when:**
- Array is NOT sorted and sorting changes answer
- Need to check ALL pairs without any elimination logic

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ TYPES OF TWO POINTER PATTERNS

### **Pattern 1: Opposite Direction (Left & Right)**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 ‚Üë              ‚Üë
 L              R

Move based on condition:
- If sum too small ‚Üí L++
- If sum too large ‚Üí R--
```

**Use Cases:**
- Two Sum (sorted array)
- Container with most water
- Valid palindrome

---

### **Pattern 2: Same Direction (Slow & Fast)**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 ‚Üë  ‚Üë
 S  F

Both move forward, but at different speeds
```

**Use Cases:**
- Remove duplicates
- Move zeros
- Partition array

---

### **Pattern 3: Sliding Window (Special case)**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    [----]
    L    R

Window slides forward maintaining size or condition
```

**Use Cases:**
- Maximum sum subarray
- Longest substring problems
(We covered this in Module 1!)

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ MATHEMATICAL THEORY

### **Why Two Pointers is O(n)?**

**Brute Force (Nested Loops):**
```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {        // Runs n times
    for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {  // Runs (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1
        // Check pair (i, j)
    }
}
```

**Total operations:** 
```
(n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 2 + 1
= n(n-1)/2  (Sum of first n natural numbers formula)
= (n¬≤ - n)/2
‚âà O(n¬≤)  (ignore constants and lower terms)
```

**Two Pointers:**
```
left = 0, right = n-1
while (left < right) {
    // Check pair (left, right)
    // Move one pointer
}
```

**Total operations:**
- Each pointer moves at most n times
- Total: n + n = 2n = O(n)

**Improvement:** O(n¬≤) ‚Üí O(n) = **100x faster for n=100, 10000x faster for n=1000!**

### **Mathematical Proof (Two Sum Problem)**

**Problem:** Find two numbers that sum to target in SORTED array.

**Claim:** If current sum > target, we can ELIMINATE right element.

**Proof:**
- Let arr[left] + arr[right] > target
- For any index i where left ‚â§ i < right:
  - arr[i] + arr[right] ‚â• arr[left] + arr[right] > target (array is sorted)
- Therefore, arr[right] cannot be part of solution
- Safe to eliminate (move right--)

**This is why sorting + two pointers works!**

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ TIME COMPLEXITY COMPARISON

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | When to Use |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(n¬≤) | O(1) | Small arrays (n < 100) |
| Two Pointers | O(n) | O(1) | After sorting, for pairs |
| Sorting + Two Pointers | O(n log n) | O(1) | When sorting allowed |
| HashMap | O(n) | O(n) | When sorting NOT allowed |

**Note:** O(n log n) comes from sorting, then O(n) for two pointers.

## üéØ PATTERN RECOGNITION GUIDE

**See these keywords? Think Two Pointers!**

| Keyword | Pattern Type | Approach |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| "Sorted array" + "pair" | Opposite Direction | Left & Right pointers |
| "Remove duplicates" | Same Direction | Slow & Fast pointers |
| "Subarray with sum/product" | Sliding Window | Left & Right (variable window) |
| "Palindrome" | Opposite Direction | Start from edges, move inward |
| "Move/partition elements" | Same Direction | Slow = boundary, Fast = scanner |
